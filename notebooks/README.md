## New network model

This folder contains an improved version of the model (still under development)

------------------------------------------------------

Improvements:

* new cell models, optimized with experimental traces
* double exponential synapses
* different recurrent weight distribution (based on a modified STDP rule)
* simulation transfered to Brian2 (and paralellized)

To run the scripts, [install Brian2](hhttp://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/install.html), [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install.html) and run:

	jupyter notebook
