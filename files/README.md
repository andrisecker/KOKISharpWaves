------------------------------------------------------

The folder contains spike trains for teaching the network (generated by [generate_spike_trains.py](https://github.com/andrisecker/KOKISharpWaves/blob/master/scripts/generate_spike_train.py)):
* spikeTrains.txt (original spike train generated with [MATLAB codes](https://github.com/andrisecker/KOKISharpWaves/tree/master/scripts/MATLAB))
* spikeTrainsB.npz *(spike trains with block style place fields (blocks of neurons with the same place field))*
* spikeTrainsC.npz *(spike trains with continuous place field (4000 different lace fields))*
* spikeTrainsR.txt *(spike trains with randomly placed place fields (4000 different lace fields))*,

as well as files for [Bayesian decoding](https://github.com/andrisecker/KOKISharpWaves/blob/master/Bayesian_inference.pdf):
* spikeTrainsR2.npz
* PFstarts.npz *(starting point of random place fields used in spikeTrainsR2)*
* spikes.npz *(recorded spikes during activity (which is used by [bayesian_decoding.py](https://github.com/andrisecker/KOKISharpWaves/blob/master/scripts/bayesian_decoding.py)))*

> note: almost every random number generation works with fixed seed, but not the random place field positioning
